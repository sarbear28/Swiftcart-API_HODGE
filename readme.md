🛒 Swiftcart API
A RESTful API for an e-commerce platform built with Node.js, Express, Sequelize, and PostgreSQL (Neon). This project enables users to browse products, manage their shopping cart, and process orders securely using JWT-based authentication.
⚙️ Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js v14 or higher → Download Node.js

Visual Studio Code

REST Client extension (for testing the API)

🚀 Getting Started
📁 1. Download the Project Folder
Access the folder via the OneDrive link shared in the submission box.

Extract it to a local directory of your choice.

📦 2. Install Project Dependencies
Open the extracted folder in Visual Studio Code. Then, in the integrated terminal, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
This will install all required packages listed in package.json.

🖥️ 3. Run the Server Locally
Start the API by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
node index.js
The server should now be running locally on http://localhost:3000 (or the configured port).

🧪 4. Test the API with REST Client
To test endpoints in VS Code:

Make sure the REST Client extension is installed
→ Install REST Client

Open the swiftcart.rest file in the root of the project

Click "Send Request" next to any of the included endpoints to test the API

Let me know if you want to include setup notes for .env, PostgreSQL config on Neon, or the Sequelize models!
